# Amazon Vine Analysis

Amazon has a service, called 'Vine' where it pays people to review products. While the number of reviews coming from this program vs. reviews overall is quite small (1.4% for our study), it is still significant. Of course, this begs the question of whether or not Vine members are reviewing products differently than non-Vine members. For this particular study we'll analyze the data to see if the Vine members are reviewing Software products more favorably than the general population.
